# FPL Prism

FPL Prism is a Fantasy Premier League decision workspace for managers who want to compare expected points, uncertainty, transfer cost and squad legality before making a move.

The product is live at **[fplprism.com](https://fplprism.com/dashboard)**. It uses the public FPL feed and keeps the reasoning visible: every projection can be opened, inspected by scoring component and compared across a real fixture horizon.

## Product

| Surface | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [Dashboard](https://fplprism.com/dashboard) | Imports a public FPL Team ID, shows the current Gameweek, live projections, confidence, the decision desk, the live market rail and a model snapshot. |
| **Overview** | Forecast, fixture and reasoning views for the leading players, with one, three and five Gameweek horizons. |
| **My Team** | Displays the imported 15-player squad, starting XI, bench order, captaincy, bank, team value, projected points, team risk, squad signals and chip guidance. |
| **Transfer Lab** | Selects players from the pitch, evaluates joint transfer packages and enforces position, budget, ownership, club-limit, availability, free-transfer and hit rules. |
| **Player Market** | Ranks the current player pool by projected points and opens the same component-level explanation used elsewhere in the app. |
| **Model** | Explains the expected-points components, fixture context, data quality, confidence, horizons, legal-transfer checks and optional market prior. |
| [8-GW Path Planner](https://fplprism.com/planner) | Searches roll, single-transfer and two-transfer paths across eight Gameweeks in Safe, Balanced and Aggressive modes. |
| [Pricing](https://fplprism.com/pricing) | Keeps the complete product free during launch. Pro and Elite are roadmap tiers; no paid checkout or automatic renewal is active. |
| **Account / sign in** | Optional Supabase-backed settings for saving a public Team ID, free-transfer default and planner style. An FPL password is never requested. |
| [FPL Prism Modelbook](https://fplprism.com/modelbook) | Public, timestamped forward-test workspace linked from the dashboard. |

The production dashboard reports the current Gameweek and model version from the live feed. The active production model is **`1.4.0`**; the live Modelbook follows the next scheduled **Gameweek 6** projection window, with GW3–GW5 preserved as immutable forward-test archives. Both surfaces show the same training status: the live target is trained through the latest completed Gameweek and uses minutes-weighted current-season evidence blended with historical priors.

## Model overview

The active model is component-based and fixture-aware. It combines:

- an explicit start / cameo / no-appearance minutes mixture with p10–p90 minutes, substitution variance and rotation risk;
- official FPL status, chance-of-playing fields and injury/fitness news as availability signals;
- position-specific goals, assists, clean sheets, saves, bonus, defensive contribution and discipline;
- player xG, xA and defensive rates with small-sample shrinkage;
- team and opponent attack/defence strength, venue, FDR, recent results and optional ClubElo;
- historical player priors from completed seasons when current-season samples are thin;
- event-aware horizons where Double Gameweeks count twice and Blank Gameweeks contribute no fixture points;
- legal transfer filtering before ranking, including budget, position, ownership and the three-player club limit;
- seeded 10,000-path simulation for expected gain, beat-hold probability, downside and p10/p50/p90 outcomes.

The optional sportsbook integration is present behind a server-side flag and is disabled in the current release (`SPORTSBOOK_ENABLED` is not `true`, and the model weight remains `0`). When no market data is available, the core model continues unchanged.

The model version is defined in [`lib/risk-v12.ts`](lib/risk-v12.ts). A version change is required for material changes to weights, priors, thresholds, simulation logic or data sources.

The latest current-season walk-forward validation through GW5 is recorded in [`reports/backtest-1.3.0-2025-26.json`](reports/backtest-1.3.0-2025-26.json). Each target Gameweek is evaluated using only earlier Gameweek rows, so the GW6 live projection remains a forward test rather than a retrospective rewrite.

### Weekly learning loop

When a Gameweek closes, its official minutes, starts, underlying rates, player
availability and fixture outcomes flow into the next projection. The model gives
current-season evidence more weight as its sample grows and keeps historical priors
for players with limited minutes. Every update is checked with deterministic model
tests and a walk-forward backtest; we do not apply a one-week blanket correction
that could overfit a noisy result. The dashboard and Modelbook publish the target
Gameweek, training cutoff and data refresh time together so the live number has a
clear provenance.

## Data and privacy

- Current player, team, event and fixture data comes from the public FPL endpoints through the routes in [`app/api/fpl`](app/api/fpl).
- Historical player priors come from the [Vaastav Fantasy Premier League archive](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League).
- Optional team-strength enrichment comes from [FPL-Core-Insights](https://github.com/olbauday/FPL-Core-Insights) / ClubElo.
- Optional sign-in and saved defaults use Supabase. Guest use remains available.
- Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights measure product usage and performance without sending Team IDs, manager names, player names, email addresses or free-form text in product events.

Read the [privacy page](https://fplprism.com/privacy) and [terms](https://fplprism.com/terms) before using or redistributing the product.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create `.env.local` from [`.env.example`](.env.example) when you need canonical URL, contact, Supabase or sportsbook settings. The public dashboard and model checks run without a database or FPL credentials.

Useful checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run model:check
npm run model:check:v12
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs the type check, both deterministic model suites, the walk-forward backtest and the production build on pushes and pull requests.

## Repository map

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | Next.js routes, metadata, legal pages and API endpoints. |
| `components/` | Dashboard, decision desk, squad pitch, planner, account and shared UI components. |
| `lib/` | FPL types and data access, projection engines, transfer logic, strategy planner, analytics and optional integrations. |
| `scripts/` | Deterministic validation, backtesting and sportsbook calibration utilities. |
| `.github/workflows/` | Continuous validation and production-build checks. |

## Deployment

The repository is connected to Vercel. A push to `main` builds the Next.js app using the checked-in [`vercel.json`](vercel.json). Keep secrets in Vercel environment variables; never commit `.env.local` or provider keys.
